# GraphBuilder

A simple Java application for plotting mathematical functions with a user-friendly interface.

## Description
GraphBuilder is a laboratory work project (â„–1, Variant 7) designed to visualize the function \( y = \frac{\tan(x^2)}{x^2 + 1} \) over a user-defined interval [0, 1.4]. The application uses Java Swing to provide an interactive GUI with dark theme support, automatic scaling, and graph rendering.

## Features
- Plotting the function \( y = \frac{\tan(x^2)}{x^2 + 1} \)
- Customizable interval input (min X, max X)
- Automatic coordinate scaling
- Visual axis labels


> ps* The program is still very raw, the graph display requires changes, as does the program interface itself.
